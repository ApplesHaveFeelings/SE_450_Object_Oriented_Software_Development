We will study object-oriented design and implementation. Among the topics of the course are: 
 Principles of object-oriented programming languages.  Principles of object-oriented design.  UML class, object, and sequence diagrams. 
 Testing methodologies.  Design Patterns.  Advanced Java Techniques. 
Java (and maybe some C#) and the UML will be used for source code examples, homework assignments, and the exams. 
You may use Java or C# for assignments and the main project. Any other languages MUST BE APPROVED BY ME before you can use them. Note that using a language other than Java will mean you will need to generate graphics yourself. 
This syllabus is subject – and likely – to change.
